The dashboard has been deployed to: https://ericnguyen21.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

##Instructions:

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.

Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file.
